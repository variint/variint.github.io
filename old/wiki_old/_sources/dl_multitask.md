# Multi-task learning

## Introduction

Multi-task learning trains a combined network for multiple tasks simultaneusly, with the goal of training a shared representation. 

### Key takeaways
* I know the difference between hard and soft parameter sharing.
* I know different approaches of weighting losses.
