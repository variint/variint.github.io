## Background


### Brain-Inspired Modular Training

* can use L1 or L2 penalty
* we have neuron layers (ni) and weight layers (wi)
* input: n0, output: nL
* $r_{i,j}$ is the neuron position in Y-axis i and X-axis j
* each index on the Y-axis represents a single layer
* the definition of j, p, q, k may differ between the paper and my graphics

### Libertarian Free Will: Neuroscientific and Philosophical Evidence

#### Information as pattern decoding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfjSzRsPmsI

THIS IS COPIED FROM THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!!!

* information and (downward) informational causation is fundamentally realized in and is about *patterns* of energy,
not amounts of energy.

* it makes sense to reduce global forces to the sum of local forces, and total amounts to the sum of local parts’ amounts

* this kind of reductionism does not make sense at all for patterns. Reductionism of global patterns to local parts of patterns and to local particle interactions fails as a program because patterns are inherently relational over space, time, and other dimensions (e.g. color relationships, social relationships, and so on).

That is, patterns and relationships are not localistic.

Patterns cannot be reduced to a level below the level where the relationships that a decoder
responds to are present, or the pattern of relationships to which a decoder is sensitive
will be lost.

But if an act of decoding can trigger a change in a physical system, say a neuron that is
tuned to a face detects a face in the visual input and then fires, thereby influencing
other neurons, then reductionistic physicalism won’t work at all, because then even non-informational
causal chains, say among local particles, become influenced by global energetic relationships.


That is, once patterns and information become causal in the universe, because of the evolution
of decoders, like neurons, that do things if patterns are present, like fire or trigger
behaviors of animals in the world, then reductionistic physicalism fails.

It requires understanding how decoders trigger other decoders, and also how decoders reparameterize
each other for possible future acts of now altered decoding.


The technical word for energetic relationships is phase (e.g., a sine and cosine wave of
the same amplitude and frequency have a phase difference of ninety degrees).
Spatial phase arises from spatial relationships (i.e. patterns), and is related to the everyday
idea of shape.

Temporal phase is related to the idea of timing.

mass, momentum, wavelength or position.
