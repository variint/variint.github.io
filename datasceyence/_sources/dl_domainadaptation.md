# Domain Adaptation

## Skill

## Description

Domain Adaptation aims to mitigate the domain shift problem when transferring knowledge from one domain into another domain. Domain adaptation can be solved by (but not limited to) generative-based, pseudo labelling-based or reconstruction-based approaches.

## Goals
* I know about what domain shifts are and what causes them.
* I know how image-to-image translation can help reducing domain shifts.
* I know how semi-supervised learning can be applied for domain adaptation.
