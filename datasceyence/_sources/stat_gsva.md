# Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA)

## Skill

### Description
Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) is a unsupervised Gene set enrichment (GSE) method for estimating variation of pathway activity over a sample population within highly heterogeneous data sets.

### Goals
* I understand the Input (Gene expression matrix) and Output (GSVA score matrix) .
* I can explain the parts of the GSVA algorithm: (1) Gene expression level statistic, (2) Rank order sample, (3) KS-like random statistic, and (4) Score distributions.
