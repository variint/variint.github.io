# Concept Alignment

## Introduction

### Description
Concept learning has the goal to increase the interpretability of a convolutional neural network by aligning features with human understanable concepts.

### Goals
* Learn about Concept Activation Vectors (CAV).
* Learn about how unsupervised clustering can be used to obtain concepts.
* Learn about what role concepts play in explainable AI.
* Learn about how concepts are used in network dissection.


## Methods
<!-- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.12936 -->

### Network dissection 
* Original version: Chapter 10 Neural Network Interpretation > Network Dissection {cite}`molnar2022blackboxbook`
Network Dissection quantifies the interpretability of a unit of a CNN. Highly activated areas of CNN channels are linked with human concepts (objects, parts, textures, colors, â€¦).
