## Evaluation and Plots

* F1 Score
* Accuracy
* ROC AUC
* Prec-Recall curve


* Spearmanâ€™s rank correlation (not commonly used for deep learning)


## Layer types:

### Pooling
Pooling is a poor way to do dynamic routing. - https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PQu2YPtcm2dQLSsu9/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-deep-learning


## Regularisation

### Early Stopping
Is used to stop the training if there is no improvement after a given number of events

### Grokking
Grokking refers to the phenomenon of deep networks exhibiting a dramatic increase in test accuracy when training past the point where training accuracy is 100% - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.13881.pdf
