# Semi-Supervised learning (SSL)

## Skill

### Description
Semi-supervised learning combines a (small) labelled with a (bigger) unlabelled dataset to perform a task such as classification or segmentation.

### Goals
* I know the difference between self-training and co-training.
* I know multiple ways to implement SSL.
* I can explain the mean-teacher approach.
* I can name the main assumptions in SSL.
