# Meta-learning

## Skill

### Description
Meta-learning (or learning to learn) tries to solve the problem of the bias/variance trade-off by learning the inductive bias from the data. The goal is to learn a new task with a small amount of training data with a small number of gradient steps.

### Goals
* I can explain the term inductive bias.
* I know alternatives to meta-learning which introduce inductive bias, such as Deep Learning, Known Operator Learning, and Prior Knowledge as Regularization.
* I understand the concept of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning.
