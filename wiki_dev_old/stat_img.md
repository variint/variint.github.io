Here are the advantages of texture features over distribution features:

    Local Information: Texture features capture local patterns and spatial relationships within the image, providing a more detailed understanding of surface variations compared to global distribution features, which may miss local nuances.

    Robustness to Noise: Texture analysis can be more resilient to noise and variations in illumination, allowing for more consistent feature extraction from images with varying quality.

    Sensitivity to Structure: Texture features are often better at characterizing specific structural elements within an image (e.g., edges, corners, and regular patterns), which is crucial for applications like medical imaging where subtle textures can indicate pathological changes.

    Reduced Dimensionality: While distribution features summarize entire datasets, texture features can encapsulate critical local information in fewer parameters, leading to more compact representations.

    Enhanced Discriminative Power: Texture features can provide greater discrimination between different classes of objects or regions within an image, particularly when dealing with complex patterns that may not be captured by simple distributions.

    Contextual Understanding: Texture features take into account the spatial arrangement of pixels, enabling the analysis of the context and relationships between various image regions, which is often lost when using distribution-based metrics.

    Interpretability: Many texture descriptors, such as those derived from co-occurrence matrices or Gabor filters, can be interpreted in terms of visual perception, making them easier to relate to human observations of textures.

    Multi-Scale Analysis: Texture features can be computed at various scales, allowing for the analysis of both fine and coarse textures within the same image, which is beneficial for applications where different textural information may be relevant.
