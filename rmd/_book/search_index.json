The goal is to generalize a finite set of observation (training data) into a general model of the domain. There are two types of inductive biases. Relational inductive biases represent the relationship between entities in a network. Non-relational inductive biases is a set of techniques that further constrain the learning algorithm. 2.1.3 Disentanglement 2.1.4 Representation Learning 2.2 Architecture 2.2.1 Generative Models 2.2.2 Encoder 2.2.3 Decoder 2.2.4 Latent Space 2.3 Applications 2.3.1 Synthesis Image 2 Image translation 2.3.2 Segmentation 2.4 Further reading Induction, Inductive Biases, and Infusing Knowledge into Learned Representations https://sgfin.github.io/2020/06/22/Induction-Intro/ "],["retina.html", "3 Retina", " 3 Retina "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
