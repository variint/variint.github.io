# Directed Acyclic Graphs



### Making communities show respect for order

In network analysis an edge between nodes generally indicates a close relation and a similarity between the two connected nodes. This is exploited to understand local features, such as centrality of individual nodes, as well as gain insights on a macroscopic structure, such as the extent of community structure.

In this work we have highlighted that in some circumstances, the absence of a pairwise relationship can be a just as useful a signal as the presence of it. Our focus has been on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) where the implicit order in such networks prohibits the direct connection of many similar nodes. As this order is intrinsic to the very nature of a DAG, our response has been to embrace this order as it reflects important features of the data. To find meaningful communities, we have turned to antichains, sets of disconnected nodes which often play a useful role in the study of DAGs and which reflect the topological properties on the networks we consider.
