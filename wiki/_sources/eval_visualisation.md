# Plotting


## Methods

* Deep learning model architecture visualization: Graph-like representation of a neural network with nodes representing layers and edges representing connections between neurons.
* Activation heatmap: Layer-wise visualization of activations in a deep neural network that provides insights into what input elements a model is sensitive to.
* Feature visualization: Heatmaps that visualize what features or patterns a deep learning model can detect in its input.
* Deep feature factorization: Advanced method to uncover high-level concepts a deep learning model learned during training.
* Training dynamics plots: Visualization of model performance metrics across training epochs.
* Gradient plots: Representation of the loss function gradients at different layers within a deep learning model. Data scientists often use these plots to detect exploding or vanishing gradients during model training.
* Loss landscape: Three-dimensional representation of the loss function’s value across a deep learning model’s input space. 
* Visualizing attention: Heatmap and graph-like visual representations of a transformer-model’s attention that can be used, e.g., to verify if a model focuses on the correct parts of the input data.
* Visualizing embeddings: Graphical representation of embeddings, an essential building block for many NLP and computer vision applications, in a low-dimensional space to unveil their relationships and semantic similarity.
