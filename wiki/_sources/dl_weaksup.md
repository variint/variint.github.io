# Weakly supervised learning

## Introduction

### Description
The partial label problem appears when an image is only partly annotated. This affects the performance of a neural network negatively.

### Goals
* Learn how semi-supervision (e.g. co-training) can help with the partial label problem.
* Learn about the difference between early-learning and memorisation.
