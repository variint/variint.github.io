### Freud's Ego and Intrapsychic Conclicts Theory
Sources: https://www.simplypsychology.org/psyche.html

According to Freud's definition, the ego is the decision-making component of our identity. It mediates between the unrealistic id and the outside world. Unlike the id, reason is the guiding force behind the ego.

Ego-depletion increases selfish decision making, but may also increase self-conflict and regret about those decisions. 

### Freud disagreement

Neurobiologically, the self is not a unified whole. Neuroscientists say the brain is like a committee—and a fractious one at that, with members frequently arguing with each other about what to do.

When brains in operation are observed, internal disputes are indicated by high rates of firing in the nerve tracts connecting the conflicting modules. This is the physical basis of what Freud called “intrapsychic conflict.”

There is even a module (the anterior cingulate cortex) that functions like a mediator trying to resolve conflicts between the other modules. This is what Freud called “the ego.”

It is only because the mind is modular that it is capable of internal conflict. A committee composed of clones would never have anything to argue about, and a brain composed entirely of the same stuff could not be “psychodynamic”—it could not interact with or come into conflict with itself.


## Brain
Sources: unsure

The brain is a highly structured entity with localized regions of neurons specialized in performing specific tasks. On the other hand, the mainstream monolithic feed-forward neural networks are generally unstructured black boxes which is their major performance limiting characteristic. 


## Biology
### Life and Death of a Neuron

Sources: Brain Basics: The Life and Death of a Neuron - https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/public-education/brain-basics/brain-basics-life-and-death-neuron

Although neurons are the longest living cells in the body, large numbers of them die during migration and differentiation. 


## Evolution

Hyperparamter tuning, grid search, ... are basically evolution

The Baldwin effect, Lamarck’s theory of evolution, Darwinian evolution, and Waddington’s genetic assimilation. All the theories offer explanations of how organisms respond to a changed environment with adaptive inherited change. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldwin_effect



### Spontaneous evolution of modularity and network motifs
Sources: https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0503610102
Little is known about the evolutionary origin of these properties. Current models of biological evolution typically produce networks that are highly nonmodular and lack understandable motifs. Here, we suggest a possible explanation for the origin of modularity and network motifs in biology. We use standard evolutionary algorithms to evolve networks. 

### Scientists find 'holy grail' of evolving modular networks
Sources: https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2013/01/scientists-find-holy-grail-evolving-modular-networks
Many biological entities, from brains to gene regulatory networks, are organized into modules – dense clusters of interconnected parts within a complex network. Engineers also use modular designs, which is why a car has separate parts, from mufflers to spark plugs, rather than being one entangled monolith.



### Evolution of Complex Modular Biological Networks:

Biological networks have evolved to be highly functional within uncertain environments while remaining extremely adaptable. One of the main contributors to the robustness and evolvability of biological networks is believed to be their modularity of function, with modules defined as sets of genes that are strongly interconnected but whose function is separable from those of other modules. 


### Baldwin effect
Sources: {cite:p}`floreano2008bio`
Baldwin Effect - evolution tends to select individuals who already (by effect of random mutations) have some of the useful features that would otherwise be learned. Better accepted than the theory of direct assimilation of lifetime modification by evolutionary mechanisms.
The morphology and behaviour of neurons is similar across animals. Evolution of the brain mainly occurred on the architecture level or connectivity of neural networks.
Something about that neurons don't really change by evolution - similar across mammals - but the architecture changes + the connectivity of neurons. Something with strength of connectivity between the neurons.
