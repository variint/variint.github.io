    DecentNet is a network that makes use of modularity and disentanglement in early layers. Each module (DecentBlock) is trained on a single concept which is derived from clustering small image patches. In order not to limit the network in learning complex representations, the DecentBlocks feed into a fusion module and subsequently into combined layers. We focus on the explainability of the fusion module's layers and channels that are the bridge between the DecentBlocks and combined layers to understand which of the less abstract early layer features contribute most to a prediction.
