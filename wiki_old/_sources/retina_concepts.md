# Concepts in the retina

## Introduction

* Image/object descriptors: position, shape, size, direction, gradients, edges, colour
* IQA: illumination, contrast
* Anatomical: vessels, optic disc, foveal avascular zone (FAZ) / macula
* Pathologies: drusen, scars, neovascularisation, atrophy
* Artefacts: Shades, Motion Artefact, Blur, Noise, Occolusion, Compression, zipper artifact, moire effect



## Artefacts:

### Artefacts in OCT: 
* Projection artifact, eye movement, Low-OCT-signal, Inner layer misidentification, Outer layer misidentification, Mirror artifact, Degraded image, Out of register scan, Cut edge artifact, Off center artifact, Motion artifact, Blink artifact
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319453414000290

* decentration, segmentation error, movement, blink, refraction shift, defocus, shadow, Z offset, tilt, projection

* loss of focus, broad, blink lines, motion artifact, specular dot, edge duplication.
